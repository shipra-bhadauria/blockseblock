"""
Provider implementation for Groq — an inference company (not a model company)
that runs open-weight models (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma) on custom LPU hardware
for very fast, low-cost inference.

WHY GROQ FOR THIS COURSE:
  Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) delivers dramatically faster inference
  than GPU-based cloud providers — often 10-20x faster at competitive pricing,
  with a generous free tier (no credit card required). This makes it ideal for:
    - Feature 10 voice pipeline: lower latency = more natural voice conversation
    - Features 7-9 agents: each planning step is a separate LLM call — speed matters
    - Eval harness: running 10+ eval cases needs to be fast to be practical
  Groq's API is fully OpenAI-compatible, so this provider needs almost no
  translation layer — tool calling, JSON mode, and streaming all work identically.

RECOMMENDED GROQ MODELS:
  - llama-3.3-70b-versatile  → best quality + strong tool calling (Features 7-9)
  - llama-3.1-8b-instant     → fastest + cheapest, ideal for chat/RAG (Features 1-6)
                                and voice pipeline (Feature 10)
  - mixtral-8x7b-32768       → 32K context window, best for long documents and
                                extended conversation history (Feature 3 long sessions)
  - gemma2-9b-it             → Google's Gemma 2, well-rounded, good structured output
  - whisper-large-v3         → STT model for Feature 10 voice transcription
